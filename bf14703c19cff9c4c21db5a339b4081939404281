Can you try creating a macro like:\n#define POINTER_TYPE(T) T*\n\nand replacing the PRIMITIVE_TYPE* here to see if it still complains? I think this is a known legitimate use here, so if there is a better way to suppress it without NOLINT, I think that would be preferable. I guess we need one for ADDRESS_TYPE as well with T\u0026.",

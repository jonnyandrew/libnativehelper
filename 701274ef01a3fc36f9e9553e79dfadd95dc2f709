      "message": "It seems to me that this needs to be memory_order_acquire, since you need the effects of the initialization to be visible if you see true. Unfortunately, that\u0027s a minor performance hit, especially on v7. But I don\u0027t see how to avoid it. The only possibility would be to rely on dependence ordering, and test the pointer rather than a Boolean. But that\u0027s always dubious, and even more so if FindClass initializes state that could be accessed without going through that pointer.\n\nThis looks to me like it\u0027s basically the canonical double-checked-locking situation. See e.g. Slide 27 in http://schd.ws/hosted_files/cppcon2016/74/HansWeakAtomics.pdf .\n\nThe other two accesses to g_class_refs_initialized below are OK as is. The second one could use memory_order_release.",

There\u0027s another change that removes this class from nativehelper into libcore which seems to be the only place it\u0027s actually needed.",

      "message": "that seems fine to me: of course this costs _something_. my point is that there\u0027s nothing here that cleans up the FindClass local reference, so that\u0027s a leak, which is not okay.\n\ni\u0027d rather keep this in libnativehelper if possible, because it\u0027s more folks _should_ be using it rather than doing this manually.",

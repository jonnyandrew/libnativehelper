Especially I have *zero* interest to do all the work to make JNIEnv* mockable - because that doesn\u0027t exist and is about a thousand lines of code.\n\nSo I\u0027m happy if you want to deal with this in a follow-up, when *right now* this is just superfluous work detracting me from actual progress in the name of some benefits I won\u0027t see until years later.",
